## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### **What Makes or Breaks Execution:**

1. **RUTHLESS PRIORITIZATION**
   - Don't try to use all 14 templates at once
   - Start with 3-4 critical templates (Week 1)
   - Add gradually as capacity allows

2. **CONSISTENT TRACKING**
   - Set up weekly update routines
   - Assign clear owners for each template
   - Protect the daily standup ritual

3. **ACTION ON INSIGHTS**
   - Data without decisions is worthless
   - Red flags require immediate response
   - Trends matter more than point-in-time data

4. **TEAM ALIGNMENT**
   - Everyone uses the same systems
   - Transparency in metrics
   - Celebrate wins, address issues quickly

5. **ADAPT AS YOU SCALE**
   - Templates are starting points, not gospel
   - Remove what doesn't work
   - Automate manual processes over time
