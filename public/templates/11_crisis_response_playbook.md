## CRISIS #1: CASH RUNWAY < 8 WEEKS

### Immediate Actions (Day 1)
**Hour 1-2: Assessment**
- [ ] Calculate exact days of cash remaining
- [ ] Identify all pending receivables (with collection dates)
- [ ] List all committed payables (with due dates)
- [ ] Model daily burn rate with zero new revenue

**Hour 3-4: Emergency Meeting**
- [ ] COO + CFO + CEO emergency call
- [ ] Review all options (bridge loan acceleration, emergency fundraising, layoffs, shutdown)
- [ ] Decide on survival strategy

**Hour 5-8: Execute Plan A**
- [ ] Accelerate all receivables (call every distributor owing money)
- [ ] Defer all non-critical payables (negotiate with suppliers)
- [ ] Freeze all discretionary spending
- [ ] Stop all non-essential production

### Days 2-7: Stabilization
**Cash Generation:**
- [ ] Emergency sale of excess inventory (even at discount)
- [ ] Halt all marketing spend

**Emergency Fundraising:**

- [ ] Consider strategic acquirer discussions (if no other option)

### Decision Tree
```
Cash Runway < 8 weeks
├─ Can raise emergency capital in 2 weeks?
│  ├─ YES → Emergency fundraise (founder loans, angels, board)
│  └─ NO → Go to Plan B
└─ Plan B: Can cut burn by 50%+ immediately?
   ├─ YES → Cut burn + stretch runway to 16 weeks
   └─ NO → Consider orderly shutdown or acquisition
```
