## The Bottom Line:

As COO of Just AZC, I was the **builder and operator**—translating vision into functioning platform. I built everything the founder didn't have time to build: the compliance frameworks, the partnerships, the vendor network, the operational systems, the go-to-market execution. 

I joined when it was just an idea. I left when it was a functioning platform with regulatory approval, paying customers, and operational infrastructure ready to scale. That's what COOs do at early-stage companies—build the machine that executes the vision.
