**Date:** January 23, 2025  
**To:** Jeremy Blackburn, CEO - ChainIT  
**From:** [Your Name]  
**Re:** ISP Agreement Terms - Required Modifications Before Execution

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive financial analysis and competitive market research, I've identified several terms in the proposed ISP Agreement that deviate significantly from industry standards and create unsustainable economics for the partnership. This document outlines specific modifications required before I can proceed with signing.

I remain enthusiastic about ChainIT's product portfolio and believe with adjusted terms, this partnership can be mutually beneficial and built for long-term success.

## Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

### 1. Commission Holdback Structure (Section 4.2)

**Current Terms:**
- 25% annual holdback with year-end release
- Subject to "performance review" before release

**Market Standard:**
- 10-15% holdback with quarterly releases
- Objective release criteria (not subjective review)

**Business Impact:**
- Current terms create severe cash flow constraints that prevent reinvestment in sales infrastructure
- Example: $100K earned = $25K held for 12+ months

**Proposed Revision:**
- **15% holdback with quarterly releases** (Q1-Q4)
- Release contingent on objective metrics: customer retention >85%, no fraud/breach incidents
- First release after 90 days (not 12 months)

---

### 2. Commission Rate Structure & Longevity (Section 3.1)

**Current Terms:**
- Year 1: 12% | Year 2: 8% | Year 3: 4% | Year 4+: 0%
- Commissions cease after 36 months despite ongoing customer value

**Market Standard:**
- 20-35% commission rates
- Perpetual or minimum 5-year commission duration
- Flat rate or modest step-downs (not 67% reduction)

**Business Impact:**
- Financial modeling shows current rates require $18M-$21M annual sales pipeline to achieve $150K net income
- 3-year cliff creates perverse incentive to churn customers before Year 4
- Cannot justify long-term customer success investment when commissions evaporate

**Proposed Revision:**
- **Year 1: 20% | Year 2: 15% | Year 3+: 10% (perpetual)**
- Alternatively: Flat 15% with no step-downs or cliffs
- Minimum 5-year commission guarantee per customer contract

---

### 3. Undefined "Baseline Usage" (Section 3.1.a)

**Current Issue:**
- Contract references "baseline usage" as threshold for commission eligibility
- No definition provided for what constitutes "baseline"
- Creates ambiguity and commission dispute risk

**Business Impact:**
- Cannot accurately forecast earnings without defined baselines
- Risk scenario: Customer uses $50K software, ChainIT retroactively claims "$75K baseline" → $0 commission earned

**Proposed Revision:**
- **Written addendum defining baseline usage for each product tier**
- Baselines fixed at contract signing (not retroactively adjustable)
- Example clarity: "Baseline usage = $10K annual for Tier 1 customers"

---

### 4. Processing Commission Calculation (Section 3.2.b)

**Current Terms:**
- 5-10% commission on "net processing margin" (not gross volume)
- No written formula for margin calculation
- Reality: $1M processing volume = ~$3,060 margin = $153-$306 commission

**Market Standard:**
- Transparent margin calculations with written formulas
- Higher commission rates (10-15%) to offset low margin base

**Business Impact:**
- Processing commissions essentially negligible despite requiring significant customer volume
- Cannot effectively sell processing without understanding economics

**Proposed Revision:**
- **Written formula for margin calculation included in contract**
- **10% commission on net margin** (eliminate 5% tier)
- Margin floor guarantee: Minimum $500 margin per $1M processing volume

---

### 5. Chargeback Liability (Pactvera MSA Section 7.3)

**Current Terms:**
- ISP liable for customer chargebacks despite no control over service delivery
- No cap on chargeback deductions from commissions

**Business Impact:**
- Unlimited downside risk from factors completely outside ISP control
- Could erase months of commission earnings from single customer incident
- Industry average: 0.5-2% chargeback rate

**Proposed Revision:**
- **Chargeback liability capped at 0.5% of ISP's total earned commissions**
- ISP only liable for chargebacks directly caused by ISP misrepresentation or fraud
- Written notification within 30 days of chargeback with dispute rights

---

### 6. Payment Terms & Frequency

**Current Terms:**
- Payment timing undefined beyond "after activation and settlement"
- Appears to be monthly payment cycles with annual holdback release

**Market Standard:**
- Quarterly payment cycles for main commissions
- Monthly commission statements for transparency

**Proposed Revision:**
- **Quarterly payment cycles** (Net 30 after quarter close)
- **Monthly commission statements** detailing: gross earned, holdback, deductions, net payable
- Payment within 30 days of customer invoice payment (not indefinite delay)

---

### 7. 1099 Contractor Status Without Base Compensation

**Current Terms:**
- Pure commission, zero base salary
- 1099 status = 42.3% total tax burden (self-employment + federal + state)

**Market Consideration:**
- Most ISP programs offer base salary ($60K-$80K) + commission OR
- Dramatically higher commission rates to offset 1099 risk

**Business Impact:**
- Zero income stability during ramp period (6-12 months)
- Cannot sustain operations without capital reserves

**Proposed Revision:**
- **Option A:** $60K annual base salary + current commission structure
- **Option B:** Increase commission rates per Item #2 above + remain 1099
- **Option C:** Quarterly minimum commission guarantee ($15K/quarter) during Year 1 ramp period

## Competitive Market Context

Recent research into comparable ISP/reseller programs reveals ChainIT's current terms are 50-70% below market standards:

**Jumio Partner Program:**
- Commission: 20-35% (no cliff)
- Holdback: 10-15% (quarterly)
- Payment: Quarterly, perpetual

**Onfido Partner Network:**
- Commission: 25-40% (no cliff)
- Holdback: 5-10% (monthly)
- Payment: Monthly, perpetual

**Stripe Partner Program:**
- Commission: 15-25%
- Holdback: 0-10%
- Payment: Real-time/monthly

These programs also provide dedicated partner support, marketing co-op funds, and technical resources that offset the ISP's operational costs.

## Proposed Path Forward

I'm committed to making this partnership work and believe these revisions align incentives for long-term mutual success. I propose:

1. **Immediate Next Step:** Schedule 60-minute call to discuss these seven items in detail
2. **Timeline:** Revised agreement terms within 10 business days
3. **Contract Addendum:** Written amendments addressing Items #1-7 above
4. **Legal Review:** My attorney reviews final revised terms before execution

**I'm prepared to sign immediately upon resolution of these items.**

---

## What This Enables

With adjusted terms, I can commit to:

- **Aggressive sales targets:** 36-72 deals in Year 1 ($7M-$18M software pipeline)
- **Long-term customer success:** Dedicated account management and expansion focus
- **Market development:** Investment in marketing, demos, and territory development
- **ChainIT advocacy:** Active referrals, testimonials, and partner ecosystem engagement

The current terms make these commitments financially impossible. The revised terms make them inevitable.

## Conclusion

I want to partner with ChainIT, but I need partnership terms that reflect industry standards and create sustainable economics. Every item above is benchmarked against market comparables and designed to align our incentives for mutual long-term success.

I'm available to discuss any of these points in detail and remain optimistic we can reach mutually agreeable terms.

Thank you for your consideration.
